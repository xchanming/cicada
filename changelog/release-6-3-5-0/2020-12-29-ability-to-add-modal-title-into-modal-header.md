title: Ability to add modal title into modal header
issue: NEXT-10654

# Storefront
* Added modal title template as a placeholder in **pseudo-modal.html.twig** with class `js-pseudo-modal-template-title-element`.
* Changed **pseudo-modal.util.js** to moving modal title from modal body to modal header with `js-pseudo-modal-template-title-element` selector.
