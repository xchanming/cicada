# Administration
* Changed method `generateVariants` in `src/module/sw-product/component/sw-product-variants/sw-product-modal-variant-generation/index.js` to load product when generate variants.
* Changed method `getList` in `src/module/sw-product/component/sw-product-variants/sw-product-variants-overview/index.js` to fix filter not working.
