    * `src/Administration/Resources/app/administration/src/module/sw-category/view/sw-category-detail-products/index.js`
    * `src/Administration/Resources/app/administration/src/module/sw-category/view/sw-category-detail-products/sw-category-detail-products.html.twig`
    * `src/Administration/Resources/app/administration/src/module/sw-category/view/sw-category-detail-products/sw-category-detail-products.scss`

    * `src/Administration/Resources/app/administration/src/module/sw-category/view/sw-category-detail-seo/sw-category-detail-seo.html.twig`
    * `src/Administration/Resources/app/administration/src/module/sw-category/view/sw-category-detail-seo/sw-category-detail-seo.scss`

* Changed location of layout assignment in `sw-category-detail-base` to `sw-category-detail-cms` component
* Added three new components:
    * `sw-category-entry-point-card`
    * `sw-category-entry-point-overwrite-modal`
    * `sw-category-sales-channel-multi-select`
* Added entry point overwrite check on save to `sw-category-detail`

    * `linkTypeValues`
    * `entityValues`
    * `mainType`

    * `isExternal`
* Added component `sw-category-entry-point-modal`
* Changed `sw-cms-layout-modal` component to also provide the layout itself with the `modal-layout-select` event as second argument.
  Internally the methods `onSelection` and `selectItem` now receive the layout itself as a new parameter.
  Also there is new data for the selected layout named `selectedPageObject` which is send with the `modal-layout-select` event as a second argument
  (the first argument is still the layout id).
* Added new block `sw_category_view_column_info` and style file to `sw-category-view` component:
    * `src/Administration/Resources/app/administration/src/module/sw-category/component/sw-category-view/sw-category-view.scss`
