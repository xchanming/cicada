# Core
* Fixed the class `Cicada\Core\Framework\Rule\DateRangeRule` to correctly evaluate date and time ranges.
    * The date and time limits are now matched correctly.
    * If no timestamp is used, the end date is now matched correctly.
    * Several tests were added to ensure the functionality of this class.
* Added method `getCurrentTime()` to `Cicada\Core\Framework\Rule\RuleContext`.
