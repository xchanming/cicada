# Core
* Changed method `save` in `Cicada\Core\Checkout\Cart\CartPersister` to dispatch an event before the cart is saved to determinate, if the cart has to be saved.
* Added new event `Cicada\Core\Checkout\Cart\Event\CartVerifyPersistEvent` to be fired before the cart is saved. This event determines, if a cart has to be saved. Furthermore, it allows modifications to the cart just before it is saved, e.g. remove unnecessary extensions.
