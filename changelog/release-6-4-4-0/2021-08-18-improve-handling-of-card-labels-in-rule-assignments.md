issue: NEXT-16754
---
# Administration
* Added property `label` to objects of `associationEntitiesConfig` array in `src/Administration/Resources/app/administration/src/module/sw-settings-rule/view/sw-settings-rule-detail-assignments/index.js`
* Changed value of `:title` prop of the card component. The title can now be defined separate from the associations entity
