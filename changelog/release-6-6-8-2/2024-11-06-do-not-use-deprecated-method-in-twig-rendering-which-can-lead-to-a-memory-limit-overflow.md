# Storefront
* Changed `Cicada\Storefront\Theme\ThemeConfigValueAccessor::get` to not use the deprecated method `Cicada\Storefront\Theme\ThemeConfigValueAccessor::buildName` as the trace in Twig rendering can become quite large which can easily lead to a memory limit overflow in `Symfony\Component\ErrorHandler\ErrorHandler::cleanTrace`, as the stack traces in Twig rendering can become quite large
