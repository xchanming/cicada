# Administration
* Changed `sw-settings-shipping-price-matrix` prices output. Only first price will be rendered. Remaining prices can be displayed using a button
* Added seperated call in `sw-settings-shipping-detail` to load restricted rule ids. Restricted rules don't need to be validated locally anymore
___
# Next Major Version Changes
## Administration removed associations
* Removed `calculationRule` association in `shippingMethodCriteria()` in `sw-settings-shipping-detail`.
* Removed `conditions` association in `ruleFilterCriteria()` and `shippingRuleFilterCriteria()` in `sw-settings-shipping-price-matrix`
