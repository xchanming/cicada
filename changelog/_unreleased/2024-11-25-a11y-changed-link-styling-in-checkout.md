# Storefront

* Changed `src/Storefront/Resources/views/storefront/page/checkout/cart/index.html.twig` and removed the non-meaningful icon
* Changed `src/Storefront/Resources/snippet/de_DE/storefront.de-DE.json` and `src/Storefront/Resources/snippet/en_GB/storefront.en-GB.json` to improve wording for better clarity and user experience
