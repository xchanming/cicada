# Administration
* Changed computed `isInherited` in `src/app/component/utils/sw-inherit-wrapper/index.js` to return true when value is an empty array.
* Changed `removeInheritance` method in `src/app/component/utils/sw-inherit-wrapper/index.js` to remove inheritance if the new value is an empty array.
