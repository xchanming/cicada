# Administration
* Changed `src/Administration/Resources/app/administration/src/app/component/form/field-base/sw-base-field/index.js` to be able to set a hint via `.xml` file.
* Added a general accessibility hint for the admin option `requireEmailConfirmation` because it is not a good practice to activate this option.
