# Next Major Version Changes
## Payment & shipping method display in Cicada 6.7
The payment and shipping method selection in the checkout in the Storefront has been improved for accessibility.
There are now all methods listed instead of only 5, which makes the `CollapseCheckoutConfirmMethodsPlugin` unnecessary and will be removed.
Also, the payment and shipping method descriptions are now only shown for the selected method.
To clean up the collapse logic, the following templates will be removed:
* `Resources/views/storefront/component/payment/payment-fields.html.twig`, integrated into `Resources/views/storefront/component/payment/payment-form.html.twig`
* `Resources/views/storefront/component/shipping/shipping-fields.html.twig`, integrated into `Resources/views/storefront/component/shipping/shipping-form.html.twig`
